This little utility can be used to extract x and y data series from
a MATLAB generated figure. The data are saved to a Microsoft Excel
file. Curves in the figure may have different x ranges. This utility 
can be easily expanded to extract x, y, and z data series from a 
3-D figure. 

MATLAB R14 or higher is needed. This utility is compiler ready.
