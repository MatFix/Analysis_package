ANALYSIS SOFTWARE FOR MICROMAGNETIC SIMULATIONS

Includes:

- Hysteresis.m reads and plots hysteresis cycles from the table.txt file

- peakfinder.m renames and scans .ovf files to find the peak location and plots its time evolution

- magnetoelastic.m reads the data on strained circular dots and plots the phase along the rim

- AMR_pde.m solves nonlinear laplace's equations to calculate the anisotropic magnetoresistance as a function of B
